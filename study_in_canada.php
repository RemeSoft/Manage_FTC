            <h2 class="about__title">Study in CANADA from Bangladesh</h2>
            <p class="about__peragraph">Most students prefer to study in universities in Canada because it is the most popular and cost effective study destination for education in the world. It is not only among the top three countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, but Canada is also ranked as the number one country in the world to live in.</p>
            <p class="about__peragraph">Canada has one of the world’s best education systems, with outstanding programs in virtually all fields. At the undergraduate level, excellent programs exist in traditional disciplines, as well as in professional fields. While the quality of education is always high, universities have their own styles : large, bustling campuses or smaller, more intimate settings; a university education in English or French; metropolitan cities or small towns. You can choose to study at large universities offering a wide range of subjects at the undergraduate or graduate levels, or at small liberal arts universities with a focus on undergraduate education. Top universities and colleges in Canada are world-renowned for their high standards, safe campuses, and educational excellence. They are at the forefront of the information technology revolution and ensure that their students are equipped for the 21st century. Many U.S. companies actively recruit on Canadian campus.</p>
